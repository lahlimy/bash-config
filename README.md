This repository contains a set of custom Bash aliases to enhance your command-line experience. Follow the steps below to set up these aliases in your Bash configuration file.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create a new Bash configuration file

Open your terminal and create a new file for your bash configuration. Choose either `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` based on your preference.

```bash
touch ~/.bashrc
# or
touch ~/.bash_profile
```

### Step 2: Open the Bash configuration file for editing

Use a text editor to open the newly created file.

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
# or
nano ~/.bash_profile
```

### Step 3: Add the provided aliases

Copy and paste the following aliases into your configuration file.

```bash
alias h='cd ~'
alias ll='ls -lA'
alias editbash='nano ~/.bashrc'
alias update='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade'
alias cls='clear'
alias myip='curl ipinfo.io/ip'
alias hgrep='history | grep'
alias gs='git status'
alias root='sudo -i'
alias ports='sudo netstat -tuln'
```

### Step 4: Save and exit

For nano, press `Ctrl + X` to exit, press `Y` to confirm changes, and press `Enter` to save.

### Step 5: Reload your bash configuration

To apply the changes, reload your bash configuration.

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
# or
source ~/.bash_profile
```

## Usage

Now you can use these aliases in your terminal to perform various tasks more efficiently. For example, type `ll` to list files with details or `update` to update and upgrade your system.

Feel free to customize these aliases according to your preferences.
